# New Pong

Coded in C Sharp and created with Unity, this game was a project that I completed for the Game Design Workshop class (GAME 3000) at Fitchburg State University in Spring 2016.

The game is a remake of the classic arcade game "Pong", and is available in two modes: A classic mode that replicates the original, and another mode referred to as "New Pong", 

## Modes and Settings
There are two modes of gameplay, both featuring the player playing against an AI opponent.

<br/>Classic Pong: A replication of the original game. First to 11 points wins.</p><br/>

<br/>New Pong: A five level battle mode, with each level cleared by reaching seven points before the AI. 
</p><br/>

The first level of New Pong features Classic Pong, while subsequent levels will feature additional obstacles that can change the direction of the ball or manipulate the speed of the ball, creating additional challenges.

Three difficulty levels are available, with harder difficulties resulting in an AI that is sharper at reading the ball and quicker at moving their paddle.

## Controls
- Up and down arrow keys (or 'W' and 'S' keys) move the paddle up and down.
- Left and right arrow keys (or 'A' and 'D' keys) move the paddle up and down at 2x speed.
- The Escape key pauses and unpauses the game.

## Launching the game
The game can be played by launching the executable in the top level directory. Selecting a 4:3 resolution is recommended, as the game is optimized for a 4:3 resolution, (the game should be perfectly playable on other resolutions as well though).
